# ⚖️ Compliance Notes – Healthcare AI Deployment

This document outlines how the hospital readmission prediction system aligns with ethical standards and data protection laws in a healthcare setting.

## 🔐 Data Privacy & Security

- **De-identification:** Patient data is stripped of identifiers before modeling.
- **Encryption:** Data in transit (API calls) and at rest (model files, logs) is encrypted.
- **Access Control:** Role-based permissions ensure only authorized personnel access sensitive modules.

---

## 📑 Regulatory Compliance

### HIPAA (USA)
- Applies to all electronic patient health information (ePHI).
- Requires:
  - Audit trails for data access
  - Secure hosting with encryption
  - Informed consent for any data use beyond treatment

### POPIA (South Africa)
- Mandates transparency, minimal data processing, and strong security.
- Patient must be informed when data is collected, stored, or shared.

## 🧠 Ethical Considerations

- **Bias Mitigation:** Model will be audited using fairness metrics and demographic subgroup performance.
- **Human Oversight:** Predictions are only used as decision support—not to override clinical judgment.
- **Transparency:** The model is interpretable (logistic regression) and feature importance can be reviewed.

## ✅ Deployment Checklist

- [x] Encrypt model and API endpoints
- [x] Publish data consent statement
- [x] Review fairness using tools (e.g., Fairlearn, What-If Tool)
- [x] Maintain model audit logs (prediction history, usage)
- [x] Provide clinicians with model interpretability guides

## 📌 Notes

Always confirm jurisdiction-specific laws before deployment. Collaborate with the hospital’s legal and compliance teams to maintain robust alignment across data, operations, and public accountability.
